I am an undergraduate student studying computational physics and statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My goal is to do a PhD in computational plasma physics - where I make use of my experience with High Performance Computing (HPC) to illustrate the behaviour of different plasmas.

I have been involved in multiple projects - mmy current research threads including computational astrophysics, scientific computing, experimental plasma physics and materials analysis.

I am also the head coordinator of PhysicsVan, an outreach program that has been running for 30 years. As the coordinator, I run physics shows at multiple schools across Illinois to get younger students interested in physics. Additionally, I co-run PURE, an undergraduate research program that pairs grad students with undergraduate students in research projects.
